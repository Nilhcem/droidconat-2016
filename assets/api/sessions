	"description": "The Kotlin programming language is gaining popularity amongst the Android developer community. It’s a modern language that gives more power in everyday routines. Kotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it’s much easier to work with when you have less verbosity or code duplication. And this is especially noticeable comparing with the soon-to-be-archaic versions of Java used on Android. But what’s even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA. It’s a pragmatic language with a very low learning curve, and can be quickly grasped by Java developers. In this talk we’ll discuss the concepts of the language that provide the desired expressiveness, as well as additional goodies designed specifically for Android.",

By presenting the Android Auto APIs with current features and restrictions as well as the development workflow and toolset the audience will have the necessary input to start coding. When we first heard about Android Auto, we had visions of an awesome smartphone/car integration in mind. Unfortunately the current use cases for apps are limited to music and texting and we have no access to vehicle data (e.g. GPS position, speed, engine type). The development of Android Auto apps is straightforward for the given use cases and your music or texting app can be easily extended to the Android Auto context. Nevertheless we found some pitfalls that we would like to share. Android Auto is bleeding edge: APIs, development tools, etc. are changing fast, documentation is rare and toolkits are still unstable. Testing the app on real car head units is difficult. The fast update cycles of the Android Auto OS with new features during the last couple of months raise our hopes, that the APIs will be extended to more interesting uses cases very soon.",

New features are pulled into the backlog, bugs pile up like candy on Halloween and deadlines move from \"We need it Tomorrow\" to \"It had to be done last week!\". As a result teams grow, new ones emerge and a once small and simple app overpasses the dex limit and requires 300 seconds for a cold build (if you're lucky, of course). At ${company_name} we value quality, but we also require speed and a continues delivery that should never stop. With seven+ teams contributing to the main app the risk of breaking the stability of the project is even higher. Thus a clean and straight forward architecture is key for a successful rollout and our QAs sanity. This talk is about our journey from a one-block app (with a twisted maze of legacy code on top), to a multi modular and sustainable project consisting of small semi-autonomous components that assemble into our flagship app. Almost like a jigsaw puzzle.",

There are a lot of possibilities for using the Nearby API, for example creating a local Multiplayer game where people nearby can join a game without internet connection, or a smart bus stop that tells you when your bus is delayed and provides entertainment while you wait.

A well performing application makes the difference between a nice looking application and one, which gets successful. You, as an Android developer, have the responsibility to delight your users, so they don’t feel how much work your application has to burden to fulfill the user’s needs. This session will show you some easy optimizations and how to avoid glitches in the application. A lot of developers would shout, that this is premature optimization. In contrary it is preventive. With a small amount of work while developing you can avoid a lot of pitfalls. You will hopefully have a better understanding of the underlying system afterwards. During the session some tools and frameworks will be presented for helping you to fulfill your mission.",

With each new crash you were risking a lot - getting bad Google Play reviews, negative comments and dissatisfied customers. Nobody likes the \"Unfortunately, your app has crashed\" dialog, but there was only so much you could do about it, beside logging the crash to a remote server. In the last couple of months a lot has changed. We've been introduced to brand new tools to help us cope with this problem. During this talk, we'll demonstrate how to use several tools and techniques that have made our lives easier. We'll discuss different ways of predicting crashes even before they occur by means of static code checkers, automatic tests and CI setup. Additionally, we'll show you how to detect memory leaks, explain advanced exception and crash logging by using a combination of several different tools. Finally, we’ll demonstrate how to provide a better crash experience or hide the crash altogether if the crash is simply inevitable!",

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is quite similar to MVP, with the view model acting as an enhanced presenter, using a data binder to keep the view model and the view in sync. By binding the view to view model properties, the data binder can handle view updates, without the need to manually set changed data back to the view (e.g. no more setText() or setVisibility() on a TextView). As with the presenter in MVP, the view model can easily be unit tested. This talk gives an introduction to the MVVM architecture and how it can be used on Android with the data binding library.",
