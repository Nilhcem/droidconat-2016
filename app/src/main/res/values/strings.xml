    <string name="venue_info">\nThessaloniki (thess-ah-lo-nee-kih), also called Salonica, is the 2nd largest city in Greece. The City offers multi-cultural centers and attractions, fancy nightlife and gastronomic spots. With its breezy mood and cozy lifestyle across you, stands perfect for travelers that have only a few days to spend. Let’s take a 1st glance!\n\nGETTING AROUND THESSALONIKI\nTo/From the Airport:\nBus 78 and 78N (Public transportation) runs every 30min from the airport to bus station via city center and train station. Ticket price is fixed (2€). Taxis to and from the airport cost approx. 15-20€, but be prepared for a doubled fare between 00:00–05:00.\n\nBus transports\nThessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) is the only public means of transport in the city. There are several types of ticket: single trip, two trips within 70min from the time of issue, three trips within 90min from the time of issue and four trips within 120min from the time of issue and can be bought at periptera (street kiosks). The 1st and 2nd ticket types can also be bought from on-board ticket machines (no exchange and a little extra charge). Travel cards are also available.\n\nCar\nProbably, it may be difficult to find free parking, but there are several rent a car offices in the city. You can find a few of them at the airport when you land.\n</string>
